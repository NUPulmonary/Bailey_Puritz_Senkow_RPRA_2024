Monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages drive lung injury and fibrosis in murine models and are associated with pulmonary fibrosis in humans. Monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages have been suggested to develop a phenotype that promotes lung repair as injury resolves. We compared single-cell and cytokine profiling of the alveolar space in a cohort of 35 patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) who had persistent respiratory symptoms and abnormalities on chest computed tomography that subsequently improved or progressed. The abundance of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages, their gene expression programs and the level of the monocyte chemokine CCL2 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid positively associated with the severity of radiographic fibrosis. Monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages from patients with resolving or progressive fibrosis expressed the same set of profibrotic genes. Our findings argue against a distinct reparative phenotype in monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages, highlighting their utility as a biomarker of failed lung repair and a potential target for therapy.
